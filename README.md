# Crime Statistics

A small app which uses data.police.uk to show crime statistics for a given area.

## Usage

A [Google Places API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key) is required to run the app.  Update index.html with your API key in the script reference:
```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>
```

Run `npm start` to launch the application.
